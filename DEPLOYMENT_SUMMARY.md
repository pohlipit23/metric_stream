### Queues
- **llm-analysis-queue**: For triggering LLM analysis workflows
- **packaging-queue**: For triggering packaging workflows
- **delivery-queue**: For triggering delivery workflows

## Next Steps

The workers are now ready for the next phase of testing:

1. ✅ **Configure cron trigger** to activate Scheduler Worker - COMPLETED
2. **Verify N8N workflows** receive triggers and send data to Ingestion Worker
3. **Confirm data appears correctly** in KV store (time series, packages, job status)
4. **Test Orchestration Worker** detects job completion and triggers queues
5. **Validate error handling paths** with simulated failures

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test worker health
curl https://ingestion-worker.pohlipit.workers.dev/api/health
curl https://scheduler-worker.pohlipit.workers.dev/api/health
curl https://orchestration-worker.pohlipit.workers.dev/health

# Run deployment test script
node test-deployment.js
```

## Configuration Notes

- All workers are configured for the development environment
- Cron triggers are active and will execute according to their schedules
- KV namespaces are shared between workers as designed
- Queue bindings are properly configured for the orchestration workflow
