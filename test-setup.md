# ðŸ”§ Setup Test Instructions

## Issues Fixed:
1. âœ… Added `/kpi-registry` route to App.jsx
2. âœ… Added Vite proxy configuration to forward API requests
3. âœ… Both `/kpis` and `/kpi-registry` routes now work

## Steps to Test:

### 1. Restart Frontend (Required!)
```bash
# Stop the current frontend server (Ctrl+C)
cd src/admin-console
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Backend is Running
```bash
# In another terminal
cd src/workers/admin-console  
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Routes
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/kpis` (navigation link)
- Or navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/kpi-registry` (direct URL)

### 4. Test API Connection
Open browser dev tools and check:
- Network tab should show API requests to `/api/kpis`
- No more "Unexpected token '<'" errors
- Should see JSON responses from the backend

## Expected Results:
- âœ… Page loads without "No routes matched" error
- âœ… KPI Registry page displays
- âœ… API calls work (no more HTML responses)
- âœ… Can create, edit, delete KPIs

## If Still Having Issues:
1. Check both servers are running on correct ports
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for any remaining errors
4. Verify the proxy is working by checking Network tab in dev tools
