# üîê Authentication Fix Test

## Issue Fixed:
‚úÖ Updated authentication middleware to bypass Cloudflare Access in development mode

## Changes Made:
1. Modified `src/workers/admin-console/middleware/auth.js`
2. Added development mode detection using `env.ENVIRONMENT === 'development'`
3. Returns mock user in development mode

## Steps to Test:

### 1. Restart Worker (Required!)
```bash
# Stop current worker (Ctrl+C)
cd src/workers/admin-console
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Worker Logs
Look for this message in the worker console:
```
Development mode: bypassing Cloudflare Access authentication
```

### 3. Test KPI Registry
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/kpis`
- Should no longer see "Missing Cloudflare Access JWT token" error
- Should see KPI Registry page load properly

### 4. Test API Endpoints Directly
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8787/health

# Test KPI list endpoint  
curl http://localhost:8787/api/kpis
```

## Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ No more JWT token errors
- ‚úÖ KPI Registry page loads
- ‚úÖ API endpoints return JSON responses
- ‚úÖ Can create/edit/delete KPIs

## Development User Info:
In development mode, all requests will be authenticated as:
- **ID**: dev-user
- **Email**: dev@example.com  
- **Name**: Development User

## Production Note:
This bypass only works when `ENVIRONMENT = "development"` is set in wrangler.toml. In production, proper Cloudflare Access authentication will be required.
