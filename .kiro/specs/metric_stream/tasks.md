# Implementation Plan: Daily Index Tracker

This document outlines the implementation tasks based on the `design.md`. The project is divided into sequential phases to ensure a logical build-out, starting with a core MVP and progressively adding features and robustness.

---

## Phase 1: N8N Prototyping & Data Contract Definition

**Goal**: Manually prototype N8N workflows to define a stable data contract (the JSON payload structure) before Cloudflare development begins.

- [ ] **Task 1.1: N8N Workflow Development (User Responsibility)**
  - [x] **Note**: User will independently develop prototype N8N workflows for 2-3 distinct KPI types (e.g., a simple Price KPI, a Ratio KPI, an Index KPI).
  - [x] User will provide webhook trigger URLs and endpoint specifications for each workflow type.

- [x] **Task 1.2: Receive Sample Payloads from User**
  - [x] **Note**: User will execute their prototype workflows and provide sample JSON outputs.
  - [x] Receive and document the exact JSON payloads for both successful runs and error conditions from user-developed workflows.

- [x] **Task 1.3: Define Finalized Data Contract**
  - [x] Analyze the sample payloads.
  - [x] Formally define and document the `KPIDataUpdate` and `KPIErrorUpdate` schemas as Python dataclasses in a shared `schemas` module.
  - [x] This contract will govern the development of the Ingestion Worker.

- [x] **Task 1.4: Validate Data Structures and Update Design Document**
  - [x] Review all JSON payloads and data structures generated from the N8N prototype workflows.
  - [x] Validate that the actual data structures align with the assumptions in the design document.
  - [x] Update the `design.md` file with the real schemas, interfaces, and data flow patterns discovered during N8N prototyping.
  - [x] Document any deviations from the original design and adjust the architecture accordingly.
  - [x] Ensure the KV store schema and key naming conventions match the actual data structures.
  - [x] Update the Ingestion Worker specifications in the design to reflect the finalized JSON payload formats.
  - [x] Define backward compatibility strategies for data structure evolution to ensure future N8N workflow changes don't break existing system components.
  - [x] Create versioning scheme for data contracts to handle schema migrations gracefully.
